A Countdown Timer is a software application that allows you to track the time elapsed for a specific task. In this Python project, we will be building a simple countdown timer that will allow you to set a timer for a specific duration and when the timer reaches 0, it will alert the user.  This project is a simple and fun project that can be useful in many situations, such as when you want to set a timer for a study session, when you're cooking, or when you're doing any task that requires you to keep track of time.
